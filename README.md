# The-Artificial-London
Artificial London Using Multi-agent System

With the continuous development of simulation technology and the improvement of computer computing capabilities, the simulation has become a hot topic in the academic sector to construct complex algorithms by modelling large-scale complex systems. Artificial society, virtual cities, and smart cities provide a new method for quantitatively studying complex social problems centred on human activities, especially those related to urban planning. 
This research will use Multi-agent System to build an artificial society: “Artificial London”. By establishing a city information model, supplemented by actual data or empirical parameter settings given by previous studies, it will research the self-organizing evolution process and the social needs of different urban forms. At the same time, through the qualitative description and the analytical model, conclusions with practical significance are obtained such as Londoners’ satisfaction distribution, economic and commuter conditions distribution.
